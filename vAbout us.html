      <h1>Who We Are</h1>
      <img src="images.jfif" alt="Who we are" class="content-img">
      <p>
        Founded in 2022, Justice For All is a youth-led initiative that grew out of student and community efforts
        to make legal knowledge available to ordinary people. We began by running legal literacy workshops in
        barangays and university campuses, then partnered with local NGOs and pro bono lawyers to offer free clinics.
      </p>
      <p>
        Our work is rooted in the belief that law should protect everyone. We focus on practical services:
        information, simple legal advice, referrals, and community organizing to address systemic problems.
