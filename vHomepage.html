    <!-- Who We Are -->
    <section>
      <h2>Who We Are</h2>
      <p>
        Justice For All is a youth-led advocacy group (founded 2022) working across the Philippines to promote access to justice,
        legal literacy, and stronger institutions. We partner with law students, civil-society groups, and public legal-aid providers
        to bring practical legal help and information to communities that need it most.
      </p>
      <p>
        Our work began with community legal literacy sessions and grew into a broader program that includes free clinics, workshops,
        and campaigns against abuse and corruption. We focus on real impact — helping people understand their rights and find legal
        assistance when they need it.

      <h2>Mission & Vision</h2>
      <p><strong>Mission:</strong> To empower communities with legal knowledge and accessible legal services.</p>

    <!-- Why This Matters -->
    <section>
      <h2>Why This Matters</h2>
      <p>
        When people cannot access legal help, injustices go unchallenged. This undermines democracy, leaves vulnerable groups exposed,
        and weakens institutions that should protect citizens. Strengthening access to justice supports safer, fairer communities.
